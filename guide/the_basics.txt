Hello and Welcome to Barra_wild, in this is a testing branch for emacsport in a attempt to get it up and running.

If your not familiar with github you can follow this quick steps inorder to get a push to the emacsport repository.

1. Go to the branch you wish to do your changes to with git checkout -b my_branch

2. then add your changed file with: git add file/location

Generally the file location will likely just be in your patches folder.
You can also eaisly see which files are changed with git status.

3. Create your commit with: git commit -m "comment about said commit"

4. Push it up to github: git push branch_name

If that does not work then you can try adding --set-upsteram origin after the word "push"
